# ESP-ionage

This very simple esprunio script can be used to toggle a power relay
at a configured pin (default is Arduino pin 13 / NodeMCU D7).

At a very high level, this script was meant to be used in presentations
or places with spotty internet reception. You can connect a wireless devices
(like your smartphone) to the access point it spins up and remote control
a powered device.
